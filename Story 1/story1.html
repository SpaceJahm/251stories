              <p class="text-justify">Once there was a Tree</p>
              <p class="text-justify">and she loved everyone very much</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And everyday they all would come</p>
              <p class="text-justify">and they would all gather the tree's leaves</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And make them into crowns and played together</p>
              <p class="text-justify">They would climb up the Tree's trunk</p>
              <p class="text-justify">and swing from the Tree's branches</p>
              <p class="text-justify">and eat the Tree's apples</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And they would play hide and seek</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And when they were tired they went home and slept comfortably in their own bed</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And they all loved that tree</p>
              <p class="text-justify">very much and the tree was happy</p>
              <p class="text-justify">But time went by</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And everybody grew up</p>
              <p class="text-justify">and the tree was left alone</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Then one day some of the everybody came to the tree and the tree said : “ Come, everyone, come and climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and eat apples and play in my shade and be happy.”</p>
              <p class="text-justify">We are too big to climb and play,” said everyone. “ We want to buy things and have fun. We want some money. Can you help us earn my own money?</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And so everyone climbed up the tree and gathered the tree's apples and carried them away. And the tree was happy . . .</p>
              <p class="text-justify">But them everyone stayed away for a long time . . . and the tree was sad. And then one day everyone came back and the tree shock with joy and she said, “ Come, everyone, climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and be happy.”</p>
              <p class="text-justify">"We are too busy to climb trees,” everybody said. “ We want a house to keep us warm,” everyone said. “ I want to have a life, and so I need a house. Can you give me a house?</p>
              <p class="text-justify">“ I have no house,” said the tree. “ The forest is my house, but you may cut off my branches and build a house. Then you will be happy.”</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And so everyone shared the trees branches and carried them away to build their house's.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And the tree was happy</p>
              <p class="text-justify">But once again, everyone stayed away for a long time. And when they came back, the tree was so happy, the tree could hardly speak. “ Come” she whispered, “ come and play.” “ I am too old and sad to play,” said everyone. “ We want a boat that will Take me far away from here. Can you give us a boat?” “ Cut down my trunk and make a boat,” said the tree. “ Than you can sail away… and be happy.”</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And so everyone cut down and shared the trunk and made a boat and sailed away.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And the tree was happy . . . but not really</p>
              <p class="text-justify">And after a long time everyone came back again. “ I am sorry,” said the tree, “ but I have nothing left to give you, my apples are gone.” “ My teeth are too weak for apples,” said everyone. “ My branches are gone,” said the tree. “ You cannot swing on them” “ We are too old to swing on branches,” everyone said. “ My trunk is gone,” said the tree. “ You cannot climb” “ We are to tired to climb" everyone said</p>
              <p class="text-justify">“ I am sorry,” sighed the tree. “ I wish that I could give you something… But have nothing left. I am just an old stump. I am sorry…” “ We don’t need very much now,” “ just a quiet place to sit and rest. I am very tired.” “ Well,” said the tree, straightening herself up as she could, “ well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting. Come, sit down. sit down and rest.” And everyone did.
              <p class="text-justify"> and the tree was happy</p>
              <p class="text-justify"> THE END</p>
