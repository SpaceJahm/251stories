            <h1>Winnie the Pooh</h1>
            <br>
            <div class="paragraphs">
              <p class="class-justify">"Hundred acre woods has been feeling a lot different recently... <br>
                I can't exactly put my finger on why" says Pooh as he digs at the bottom of his honey pot.
                "Think think think" Pooh says aloud, as he puts his hand on his chin to think. <br>
                "What possibly could it be?" <br> <br>  After a few seconds of thinking, Pooh realizes he was not paying
                attention to the honey, and that he was spilling and making a mess. <br> "Oh Bother" he exclaims,
                "I am getting honey all over!" <br> and it was in that moment when Pooh realised what was different. <br>
                "My honey! I'm spilling it everywhere, and yet I am having trouble finding it everywhere! This is unusual" he noted.<br>
                <br>
                Later that day Pooh rallied up two of his friends, Piglet and Eeyore to go explore, in hopes of figuring out what exactly was going on.
                As they began walking further and further into the woods, the tree line began to thin but the air began to feel thicker; to the group, this was unusual.
                As they approched the edge of the tree line, the ground began to crunch a little, with a fine layer of white and black covering the surface;
                that is when things began to really looked out of the ordinary. A short silence fell over them... <br>
                <br>
                "Where are all the trees?!" Piglet exclaimed. <br>
                "Where are all the bees?!" Pooh questioned. <br>
                Eeyore sighed "So this is what the world has come to?" <br>
                <br>
                Another short silence fell upon them as they looked over the wreckage of the woods. <br>
                "What do you think happened?" said Piglet, as he trembles behind the others. <br>
                A big sigh came from Eeyore as he said "It looks like someone was cutting down the trees for wood. They must have started
                a fire before they abandoned the area too, that explains the thick air and ash." <br>
                "That still doesn't explain where the bees are!" Pooh exclaimed. <br>
                "Well actually, less plants and trees in the area means less habitat for the bees, which would explain why there are less hives and less honey.
                The smoke also probably scared the bees away from the close hives, as the bees would rather be in a safer area. but what do I know?
                No one listens to me anyway" said Eeyore. <br>
                "We're listening" said Piglet. <br>
                <br>
                "Do you know how to fix things?" asked Pooh. "I need more honey." <br>
                "Things won't be fixed overnight. It's going to take a while before the habitat is healthy and thriving again.
                We can plant some seeds to try and help the growth process, but we have to let nature take its course after that" said Eeyore.
                "If you help protect our woods and our world, you help protect all the things you love in our world... like honey." <br>
                "Oh bother, I guess I can hold off on honey for now, so the bees can replenish their resources" said Pooh. <br>
                <br>
                “There you go" said Eeyore, "A little Consideration, a little Thought for Others, makes all the difference.”
