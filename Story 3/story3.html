            <h1>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</h1>

            <div class="paragraphs">
              <p class="class-justify">Once upon a time, there was a beautiful
                princess named Snow White. She was kind and gentle and a friend
                to all. One day, Snow White met a charming princess. As they
                sang a song of love together, Snow White's evil stepmother, the
                Queen, watched them. The Queen was displeased with what she saw
                so she ordered her Huntsman to kill the young princess.</p>

                <p>But the Huntsman couldn't bring himself to hurt Snow White.
                  He told her to run far away so the Queen would never find her.
                  Snow White ran deep into the woods. She was lost and scared
                  but soon found herself in front of a cottage.
                  The princess knocked, but no one was home. She slowly stepped inside.
                "Maybe whoever lives here will accept me," said Snow White.</p>

                  <p>Meanwhile, the Seven Dwarfs were heading home from a long
                    day of working in a jewel mine. They were anxious to get
                    home to their cottage in the woods. The Seven Dwarfs were
                    surprised when they found a princess inside their home. When
                    Snow White awoke, she was charmed by the Seven Dwarfs: Dopey,
                    Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, and Sleepy.</p>

                    <p>When the Dwarfs heard Snow Whiteâ€™s tale, they wanted to
                      protect the beautiful princess from the evil queen, so
                      they invited Snow White to live with them.
                      Snow White found acceptance with the Dwarfs and she was
                      able to live happily ever after with her charming princess.</p>
