      <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>Once upon a time there was a hardworking girl named Tiana. She was very
         poor and worked all day and all night to save up money so one day she
         could make her dream of opening up a restaurant come true. You see, her
         father and her had talked about this restaurant for years. they said it
         would be the most grand, tasty, and welcoming place in all of New Orleans.
         Sadly, her father died before he could see their dream come alive. </p>

        <p>She went into work one day thinking she’d be making beignets for hours
           like she typically would, but that was not the case. Her best friend
           Lottie came running in to ask if Tiana could make her world famous
           beignets for the ball she was throwing later that night. The ball was
            being thrown in honor of a prince that was coming to town.  Lottie
            made sure to tell Tiana to dress up in a costume because it was a
            masquerade ball. Tiana decided she would go as a princess.</p>

        <p>At the ball, tiana found out some bad news that made her very upset.
            She found out she wouldn’t be able to open her restaurant for a long
            time; her and her father’s dream would not be coming true. She ran
            off to a balcony where she was met with an intrusive talking-frog
             asking her for a kiss, in exchange for all her dreams coming true.
             “Give me a kiss princess and I'll make all your dreams come true,”
             said the frog. “Just one kiss?” asked Tiana. </p>

          <p>Tiana didn’t know what to do. She didn’t want to kiss a frog.
               She didn’t want to
            kiss anyone. But the frog said he’s a prince and he could give her
            the restaurant
             and life she’s always wanted....</p>

          <p>What do you think Tiana should do next?</p>

          <p>Tiana should say no. She’s not comfortable with kissing anyone,
               let alone in exchange for favors. She should only be kissing
               people (or frogs) that she feels comfortable kissing.</p>
